The main function is in PeterTest.
Please add any code for other sensors to this folder.
Call/e-mail me with questions.
Remember to reupload to the github.

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:

There are two versions of the LM73 code, one in /includes and one in
/test. I've included the one in /test, if it throws errors try using the
other one before you edit the function.

Read through PeterTest.cpp, there's some TODOs in there that need to be
resolved before everything will be operational.
